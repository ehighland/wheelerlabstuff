Run BSLMM on all HapMap3 pops
Look in similarly named folders
-Individual pops
-Also do everyone combined
-Continental groups

Lauren will also need BSLMM done for her data

After we have run everything through BSLMM, can extract important or interesting genes
Summarize data
Combine with Aly's elastic net stuff

Populations: MKK, MEX, GIH, LWK (do not run), CHB, JPT 
YRI already run
Will now run MKK
