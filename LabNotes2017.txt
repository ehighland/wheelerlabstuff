Run BSLMM on all HapMap3 pops
Look in similarly named folders
-Individual pops
-Also do everyone combined
-Continental groups

Lauren will also need BSLMM done for her data

After we have run everything through BSLMM, can extract important or interesting genes
Summarize data
Combine with Aly's elastic net stuff

01/30/17 notes
Populations: MKK, MEX, GIH, LWK (do not run), CHB, JPT 
YRI already run
Currently running: GIH chromosomes 1 - 4 on cores 8 - 11

01/31/17
Running: GIH chromosomes 5 - 8 on cores 5 - 8 (in same order)
Completed: GIH chromosomes 2, 3, and 4

Once done running, generate same figures as for YRI

Work on single populations for now
Will want to adjust expression levels
for ancestry principle components -- software: Smart PCA

For code: can take up to 6 cores
Can start by combining 

Get a variable for core # and for chromosome #

Most efficient way: work backwards? Take advantage of smaller chromosomes 
(18-22) 

Could also go by numbers of genes per chromosome?

Script of scripts
Just a script to run BSLMM
nohup script to call that script -- 6 commands for 6 cores
Each nohup script is calling a different number of chromosome commands

Look at file size and divide into 6 groups

Can later have a variable for population

02/01/17
GIH chromosomes 1-8 are completed.
I am working on the "script of scripts"

02/05/17
Splitting all the un-run chromosomes into 6 groups, each of which has a .sh file and
each of which will be sent to a separate core
Groups: 
1 -- Chromosome 10
2 -- Chromosomes 11, 21
3 -- 12, 22
4 -- 9, 16, 20
5 -- 13, 17, 19 
6 --- 14, 15, 18

Using cores: 1 - 6

02/07/17
All GIH chromosomes have been run. Additionally, the relevant data from each GIH file has been combined into 
one file: GIH_results.txt.

Next up: JPT

Groups:
1 -- Chromosomes 1, 21, 7 
2 -- 2, 22, 8, 17
3 -- 3, 19, 18, 10
4 -- 4, 16, 9, 12
5 -- 5, 15, 14
6 -- 6, 20, 13, 11

Meeting with Dr. Wheeler
************************
Looking ahead: pve50 for each gene in each population (percent variance explained) can be compared. Pearson 
correlation between each population.
After JPT, do CHB. Can run East Asians together. Aly will soon be done with LWK, can proceed with African groups. 
When combining, put input matrices together. Right now, calling genotype and expression files. Use cat. 
When combining results to plot, add column with population shortcut. I.e. pop column with YRI or GIH, etc. 

Could have for loop. Nohup is inherited.  
Put 6 nohup commands in a script. USE AMPERSAND at end!!! Maybe use echo?

Update:
All 6 groups are currently running on cores 6 - 11.

02/08/17
None of the JPT chromosomes finished. Computer possibly restarted? 
There's a high load of activity right now, so I'm only going to use 4 cores
(7, 8, 9, and 10).

02/09/17
JPT chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 16, and 18 have finished. 
Everything else is still running on cores 7-10. 
I'm going to run the remaining two groups now on cores 6 and 11.

8:30pm update -- 22 now also done!

02/10/17
JPT chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22 are done

02/11/17
All JPT chromosomes are done. The files have been prepared for R graphing via my 
combineAndFilter python script.

Now I am moving on to CHB.

Groups for cores:
1 -- 21, 14, 2, 12
2 -- 1, 16, 22, 8
3 -- 17, 15, 19, 3
4 -- 5, 13, 11
5 -- 20, 4, 9
6 -- 7, 6, 10, 18   

Running now on cores 6-11.

02/12/17
As of 12:55pm, CHB chromosomes 13, 14, 17, 20, 21, 5,and 7 have finished 
running.

02/13/17
As of ~2:40pm, CHB chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 are done running. 
Chromosomes 3, 8, 12, and 22 are still running. 
 
02/14/17
All CHB chromosomes are done running.
CHB chromsomes have also been run through combineAndFilter.py

Remaining populations: MEX and MKK

Wheeler Meeting
****************
Can run MEX and MKK next but figure out a method to combine East Asian pops. Then combine East Asian with python
script.
Can sign up for URES with this project and present data in lab meeting.

02/21/17
Running MKK

Groups for cores:
1 -- 21, 14, 2, 12
2 -- 1, 16, 22, 8
3 -- 17, 15, 19, 3
4 -- 5, 13, 11
5 -- 20, 4, 9, 18
6 -- 7, 6, 10

Groups 1-6 are running on cores 1-6

02/22/17
Had some sort of problem with MKK. Now running MEX in the same groupings
as above (for MKK). Groups 1-6 are running on cores 1-6.
I've also made a lot of progress with a python script to add a 
population column. The script is called getItTogether.py

02/26/17
MEX is done running. All individual populations have been processed except for MKK and LWK. 
I have figures (in R Markdown files) for all the populations I've processed except MEX. 

02/28/17
Problem with MKK: check numbers of cols and rows in each file
Could be that large one includes people in smaller matrix
Could be that there are more people in one file
Python script

For gemma, multiple SNPs going to each gene
Key thing: number of people needs to be the same (NA- numbers at top of file)

Run gemma with ***people*** combined
--> Make a NEW genotype matrix with Japanese AND Chinese people
----> Go into input files (genotype file -- gt)
----> top row would be CHB1...JPT1...etc
----> Looking for overlap
---> When merging, only keep SNPs that overlap/are in both/intersection

What I have is useful for +facet_wrap(pop) -- PGE vs. PVE

Plot should look tighter with CHB and JPT combined 

LWK and MKK still being worked on
LWK -- predixcan -- is new imputation good?
--> Compare predicted to observed and look for good correlation
Might be similar issue with MKK

For now: Focus on getting MKK working and combine CHB and JPT

After break: potentially look at MESA
Have MKK and Asian population figured out by next meeting (March 14th)

03/04/17
The Expression file for JPT and CHB (with only overlapping SNPs) has been generated!
I'm adding the code that generated the overlap file to github.

03/14/17
Consider combining in R rather than python
-->Good practice in Python
-->Rewrite in R!
---->In R package called dplyr
------>Can join the Illumina IDs -- any gene in one population but 
not the other would be excluded.
The gt files will be pretty big! Don't remake them all.

Cheatsheet for dplyr

Use original files -- all IDs are unique so no need to add -CHB or -JPT

LWK is ready -- check with Aly
MKK will be done soon

Combine African pops

MESA data in a week or two -- what format? Slightly different from 
existing files. Maybe have to tweak code.
Lauren is presenting at glbio in May, get done before then.

03/20/17
I'm now running MKK again on cores 1-6. Everything appears to be working
this time!

03/21/17
MKK still weird -- missing column?
Use R read.table to look at gzipped file to check if all MKK chromosome files are missing this column
Open in Excel to check amount of cols
Check with Aly -- did she modify code to exclude dotted column?
If dotted column removed would colnames be the same size?

For R: try R package data.table

UPDATE: R script is now working, thanks to locating the *correct* files

03/27/17
For running the Asian group, I have combined Expression, SNPs, and SNPs_Location files. 
I am currently working on modifying a copy of the bslmm_for_emma.r script to use
these combined files. 

I am curious about the allelecode part in the original bslmm_for_emma.r file...how
should I handle this with two groups?  

03/28/17
So only use SNPs present in both JPT and CHB files
--> redo the combos with inner_join

Note: to get rid of row numbers
write.table(file, "filename", quote=F, row.names=F)
-->Will get rid of quotation marks and row numbers

The key: want to end up with same order (CHB then JPT)

allelecode --> can do same type of inner_join

Just keep combining input files!

Ask Aly about gt files -- see to do list

2:38pm update: snps.sh and anno.sh are running again to re-do 
the gt and annotation files.

10:40pm update:
All the files are combined, but it's not working yet. I am getting the
Illumina gene names, but not the stats. All the stats show as NA.

04/04/17
In an attempt to fix BSLMM issues, I'm re-running the SNP annotation combination
for CHB and JPT (in that order!) I realized that r script did not
have "quote=F, row.names=F" in write.table. I think that having row numbers
and quotes maybe threw off the bslmm_for_asian.r code. 

Note: this ^ turned out to not fix anything!

MEETING NOTES
************
Sometimes when data is combined it might be read as a factor instead of 
a character. We need it to be read as a character for string
matching. Double check!

Check that SNP annotation file is same size as SNP genotype file.

Could try setting i=1 in "for(i in 1:length(explist)){" and
stepping through/debugging in R Studio

Compare CHB original to combined --> make sure CHB data is perserved
correctly

For this line:
cisgenos <- subset(popgt,popgt[,3]>=start & popgt[,3]<=end) ### pull cis-SNP genotypes
Check 3rd column from popgt!

Initial popgt:
popgt <- left_join(snpcode,gt,by=c("snp"="id"))

Eventual popgit:
popgt <- popgt[popgt[,3] %in% allelecode$POS,] #only keep SNPs in allelecode file (removes esv SNPs)

For MKK:
One person has all missing data, as previously encountered.
To move forward, just ignore this column?
 
For now, focus on Asian group!

Post filepath for elastic net script and gemma script on slack for Dr. Wheeler

04/05/17
Chromosome 22 from the combined Asian population is running now! I'm not 100% sure
how I resolved the error. The variables popgt and cisgenos were both 
fine when I ran tests (i.e. all the data appeared to be in the right place).
The only change I made was to allelecode. Rather than have one line like so...
From the original bslmm_for_emma.r file:
allelecode <- read.table("/home/wheelerlab1/elastic_net/allele_annot_files/chr" %&% chromosome %&% "_" %&% pop %&% ".txt.gz")

I shifted to two lines of code -- one to defined a variable allele.file and another for
allelecode:

allele.file <- "/home/emma/AsianGroupFiles/alleleAnnotation/combined_CHB_JPT_22_allele_annotation.txt"
allelecode <- read.table(allele.file,header=TRUE)

I explicitly defined the allele.file here, so I suspect that something was
going wrong with grabbing the allele annotation files? I'm not sure
what, though.

Long story short: Chromosome 22 is working!
