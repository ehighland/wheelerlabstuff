Run BSLMM on all HapMap3 pops
Look in similarly named folders
-Individual pops
-Also do everyone combined
-Continental groups

Lauren will also need BSLMM done for her data

After we have run everything through BSLMM, can extract important or interesting genes
Summarize data
Combine with Aly's elastic net stuff

01/30/17 notes
Populations: MKK, MEX, GIH, LWK (do not run), CHB, JPT 
YRI already run
Currently running: GIH chromosomes 1 - 4 on cores 8 - 11

01/31/17
Running: GIH chromosomes 5 - 8 on cores 5 - 8 (in same order)
Completed: GIH chromosomes 2, 3, and 4

Once done running, generate same figures as for YRI

Work on single populations for now
Will want to adjust expression levels
for ancestry principle components -- software: Smart PCA

For code: can take up to 6 cores
Can start by combining 

Get a variable for core # and for chromosome #

Most efficient way: work backwards? Take advantage of smaller chromosomes 
(18-22) 

Could also go by numbers of genes per chromosome?

Script of scripts
Just a script to run BSLMM
nohup script to call that script -- 6 commands for 6 cores
Each nohup script is calling a different number of chromosome commands

Look at file size and divide into 6 groups

Can later have a variable for population

02/01/17
GIH chromosomes 1-8 are completed.
I am working on the "script of scripts"
